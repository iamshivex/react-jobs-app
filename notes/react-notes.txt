State Management
  We have component level state and app level state
  We use state by importing the {useState} hook from react

  Then we define the state and name it thus:

  const[doThis, setDoThis] = useState(false)

  What this does is to define the state, name it and the function that We'd use to activate it. Also, a default state is set

Events
  Use onClick to add events

useEffect hook
  it allows components to have side effects
