variable is a bucket for storing data
we use var function to store data that can be changed
we use let or const function to store unchangeable data
objects are used to store more than one variables
the variables in an object are called properties
objects are also a reference type because they allow us to store multiple data types
    unlike primitive types which only store one data
arrays are objects that are used to store a list of data using square brackets
function is a bucket for saving saving code logic
    they collect argument in parentheses
    they allow us to implement code logic without rewriting the logic
or operator returns true if at least one of the values is true
and operator returns true if all values are true
not operator returns the opposite of a value
logical opeartors are used to perform logical functions which typically returns a boolean value
false values include: undefined, null, 0, false, ", NaN
operator precedence: PDMAS
for loops contain initialisation, condition and implementation
// difference between for loops and while loops is the arrangemnet of teh syntax
// for loops is used when the number of iteration is known beforehand
// while loops is used for when it's not known
// for in loop is used to iterate a javascript object and access its values
// for off loops is used to iterate over an array to access the element
A function within an object is called a method
A variable within an object is called a property
JavaScript oobjects are used to store key value pairs.
    Their purpose is to store state and behaviour
    State is represented  by properties
    Behaviour is represented by functions within the object i.e method
factory functions provide an efficient way to create a new object.
Primitive values are passed by copy
objects are copied by reference
primitivae are copied by values
arrow function syntax:
    const add = (param1, param2) => {
        return param1 + param2
    }
Any parameter that doesn't have an explicit argument is automatically assigned as undefined so that functions don't break
Arguments are array-like i.e. they're iterable by some array methods
Classes are used to create reuseable objects
Modules are files
Object Oriented Programming is a programming pattern that is centred around objects rather than functions
The four key pillars of OOP are:
    Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
Encapsulation is the grouping of related variables and functions into an object
An object with more than one method has "behaviour"
